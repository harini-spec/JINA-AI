## What is the Project about ?

- [ ] Jinica -- Jina + Musica (En espagnol)
- [ ] The project is based on matching a query word with the lyrics of a song.                                                       
- [ ] Finding the best possible match for a word in the lyrics of a song, which can be helpful while playing "Song Association Game" 

## Why did we create it in the first place ?

- [ ] We're all music lovers, and jam to any given song playing
- [ ] We participated in the collaborated event with JinaAI X Featurepreneur, as we were genuinely interested  		in learning more about JinaAI, and wanted to explore different libraries in ML.
- [ ] And lastly we're all music lovers, and would jam to any given song playing anywhere at anytime. So we wanted to focus the project primarily on "music" and finding/matching the words to the lyrics.


## How did we make the project ?

- [ ] We built our project using JinaAI (Document, Flow, Executor).
- [ ] Made some graphs - Bargraphs, Density-Contour charts for visualizing the data that we manually built.
- [ ] We've attached a video for a better explanation regarding our project.
